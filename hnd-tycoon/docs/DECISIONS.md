# DECISIONS

Append-only log of choices that deviate from the spec, or that resolve an
ambiguity the spec left open. One entry per decision. Keep them short.

Do not delete entries. If a decision is reversed, add a new entry that says so.

## D001 — Inlined mulberry32 instead of `seedrandom`
**Step 1. Status: active.**

The spec names `seedrandom` in the stack. Used an inlined mulberry32 instead.

Why: zero dependencies; the entire PRNG state is a single uint32, so it
serialises into the save file with no special handling; and behaviour is
guaranteed identical across Node versions and browsers, which matters because
byte-identical output is a gate.

Cost: none identified. Reverse by swapping `src/sim/rng.ts` if a distribution
property is ever needed that mulberry32 can't provide.

## D002 — `npm run gate` composite script
**Step 1. Status: active.**

Added a single `gate` script chaining boundaries → typecheck → test → balance,
so the per-step gate is one command and can't be partially run by accident.

## D003 — Money as integer cents, not float dollars
**Step 0. Status: active.**

The spec requires the P&L to reconcile to the cent over a 90-day run (step 6
gate). Float dollars cannot do that — `0.1 + 0.2` alone breaks it, and a 90-day
run accumulates thousands of additions.

`Money` is `{ cents: integer, currency: CurrencyCode }` with an arithmetic
module that refuses to mix currencies. Test `money.test.ts` sums 10,000 × $0.10
and asserts exactly $1000.00.

## D004 — §26 enforced by the type system rather than by review
**Step 0. Status: active.**

The forbidden-hardcode list was documentation, and documentation loses to a
deadline. Every item that could be a type now is one: branded `GameTime` and
`Tiles`, `Money`, `Site`/`SiteKind`, `ReputationMap`, generic `Route`.

Cost: slightly more ceremony at call sites. Worth it — these are the exact
mistakes that are free today and a rewrite in Act III.

---

## D005 — Pending gates as `it.todo` tests
**Step 0. Status: active.**

Exit criteria in `BUILD_PLAN.md` are prose, and prose gates get declared
"essentially met". `tests/gates.pending.test.ts` restates them as todo tests to
be unskipped at the start of each step, failed, then passed.

What the spec said, what we did instead.

Why.

Cost, and how to reverse it.
